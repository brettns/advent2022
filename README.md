# Advent of Code 2022

Using .NET 7 and the latest C# 11 features to complete advent of code challenges.

Days of Interest:

* [Day04](https://github.com/brettns/advent2022/blob/main/Day04.cs) – I just like how clean and straightforward this one turned out
* [Day06](https://github.com/brettns/advent2022/blob/main/Day06.cs) – Boyer-moore style string search and ReadOnlySpan\<T\> for high performance
* [Day09](https://github.com/brettns/advent2022/blob/main/Day09.cs) – Struct with overloading to make the actual code more readable. Yield return switch is quite nice. Struct should ideally have static Up, Left, Down, Right values.
* [Day12](https://github.com/brettns/advent2022/blob/main/Day12.cs) – BFS shortest path, linq, more yield return for lower memory usage.
